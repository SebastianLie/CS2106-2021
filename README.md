# CS2106 Operating Systems - 20/21 Sem 2

Contains all lab assignments and my solutions to them.

All assignments were fully correct except lab4/ex4 (quite sure this is the one I did not get), I have not corrected it yet and do not intend to do so, so refer to it with caution.

I also included the cheatsheet for chapters 7-12 I used for the Final.
If you would like to edit it, you can use the main.tex file provided. 
Note that you will also need the llncs.cls file. (I recommend using Overleaf to do so.)

If you have found this useful, consider starring and making your own work 
available too! To any juniors taking this in the future, I wish you all 
the best, this module is not easy, but I'm sure you can do it (survive or thrive...) with perseverance and commitment.
